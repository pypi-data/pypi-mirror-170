# ü§èüèª `investpy` but made tiny

Suuuuuuuper simple and tiny `investpy` replacement while I try to fix it! Here I'll try
to add more or less the same functionality that was developed for `investpy` while keeping this
package tiny and up-to-date, as some solutions just work temporarily.

Everyone using `investiny` please go thank @ramakrishnamekala129 for proposing this solution
that seems to be stable and working fine so far (fingers crossed!). Also take the chance to explore
any other solution proposed by the `investpy` users at https://github.com/alvarobartt/investpy/issues.

I'm currently waiting to have a conversation with Investing.com so as to see whether we can get
to some sort of an agreement in order to keep `investpy` alive.

In the meantime you can follow me at https://twitter.com/alvarobartt as I post updates there, and
I highly appreciate your feedback.

@adelRosal, an `investpy` user created a change.org site so as to show some support, so please sign
the petition as it may be useful towards the continuity of `investpy` at https://www.change.org/p/support-from-investing-com-for-the-continuity-of-investpy-library

Finally, remember that `investiny` is super simple and tiny and shouldn't be considered reliable, it's
working fine so far, but it may be discontinued, so please use it carefully.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

ü§èüèª `investiny` requires Python 3.9+ and can be installed with `pip` as it follows:

`pip install investiny`

## üíª Usage

Retrieve historical data from Investing.com using the Investing.com ID of the asset
that you want to retrieve the data from.

```python
from investiny import historical_data

data = historical_data(investing_id=6408, from_date="09/01/2022", to_date="10/01/2022") # Returns AAPL historical data as JSON (without date)
```

There's also a function to look for assets in Investing.com, that also lets you retrieve
the Investing.com ID that you can later on use in `historical_data` as input parameter.

```python
from investiny import search_assets

results = search_assets(query="AAPL", limit=1, type="Stock", exchange="NASDAQ") # Returns a list with all the results found in Investing.com
```

As `search_assets` returns a list of results, you can check each of them, and retrieve the `ticker` from the
asset that you want to retrieve historical data from and pass it as parameter to `historical_data`. So on, the
combination of both functions should look like the following:

```python
from investiny import historical_data, search_assets

search_results = search_assets(query="AAPL", limit=1, type="Stock", exchange="NASDAQ")
investing_id = int(search_results[0]["ticker"]) # Assuming the first entry is the desired one (top result in Investing.com)

data = historical_data(investing_id=investing_id, from_date="09/01/2022", to_date="10/01/2022")
```

## üîÆ TODOs

- [X] Add Search API as also available https://tvc4.investing.com/.../search?limit=30&query=USD&type=&exchange= (thanks again @ramakrishnamekala129) (also requested in [#4](https://github.com/alvarobartt/investiny/issues/4))
- [ ] Include date formatted as %m/%d/%Y in output JSON
- [ ] Add simple scraper for Investing.com IDs?
- [X] Add error basic error handling
- [X] Should `historical_data` work without `from_date` and `to_date` inheriting `recent_data` behavior?
- [ ] Even though it's working fine so far and it seems stable, should we run stress tests?
- [ ] Ideally we should keep the lenght of `investiny` code to less than 200 lines total?
- [ ] Add more issues so that community can contribute (also Hacktoberfest 2022 is starting?)
