<p>The are classes which hold information about individual instances of Imfit image functions
(FunctionDescription), the function sets which group one or more functions with a common central
coordinate (FunctionSet), and finally Models which combine all function sets with optional
image-description information (ModelDescription, SimpleModelDescription).</p>
<p>Each FunctionDescription, in turn, holds a set of ParameterDescription objects,
which keep track of parameter names, initial or current values, and limits.</p>
<p>To properly instantiate an instance of the Imfit class, you must supply it with a previously
generated instance of the ModelDescription (or SimpleModelDescription) class.</p>
