    ### Args:
        * accessId (str): Access ID for identifying the requesting client. Get your key on [RMV website](https://opendata.rmv.de/site/start.html).
        * json (bool, optional): Whether response should be retrieved as JSON. XML is returned if False. Defaults to True.
        * dateB (Union[str, datetime], optional): Sets the event period start date. Represented in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. By default the current server date is used. Defaults to None.
        * dateE (Union[str, datetime], optional): Sets the event period end date. Represented in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. By default the current server date is used. Defaults to None.
        * timeB (Union[str, datetime], optional): Sets the event period start time. Represented in the format `hh:mm[:ss]` in 24h nomenclature. Seconds will be ignored for requests. By default the current server time is used. Defaults to None.
        * timeE (Union[str, datetime], optional): Sets the event period end time. Represented in the format `hh:mm[:ss]` in 24h nomenclature. Seconds will be ignored for requests. By default the current server time is used. Defaults to None.
        * weekdays (Union[str, OrderedDict[str, bool]], optional): Bitmask or an OrderedDict for validity of HIM messages based on weekdays. OrderedDict must be formatted as follows: `OrderedDict(Monday=bool, Tuesday=bool, Wednesday=bool, Thursday=bool, Friday=bool, Saturday=bool, Sunday=bool)`. Each character of a bitmask represents a weekday starting on monday. Example: Only find HIM Messages valid from monday to friday: `1111100`. Defaults to None.
        * himIds (Union[str, list], optional): List of HIM message IDs as a list or as a string separated by comma. Defaults to None.
        * hierarchicalView (bool, optional): Return parent messages with childs. Defaults to False.
        * operators (Union[str, list], optional): List of operators as a list or as a string separated by comma. Defaults to None.
        * categories (Union[str, list], optional): List of train categories as a list or as a string separated by comma. Defaults to None.
        * channels (Union[str, list], optional): List of channels as a list or as a string separated by comma. Defaults to None.
        * companies (Union[str, list], optional): List of companies as a list or as a string separated by comma. Defaults to None.
        * lines (Union[str, list], optional): Only HIM messages for the given line are part of the result. To filter multiple lines, separate the codes by comma. Defaults to None.
        * lineids (Union[str, list], optional): Only HIM messages for the given line (identified by its line ID) are part of the result. To filter multiple lines, separate the line IDs by comma. Defaults to None.
        * stations (Union[str, list], optional): List of (external) station ids to be filtered for as a list or as a string separated by comma. Defaults to None.
        * fromstation (str, optional): Filter messages by line segment starting at this station given as (external) station id. Defaults to None.
        * tostation (str, optional): Filter messages by line segment travelling in direction of this station given as (external) station id. Defaults to None.
        * bothways (bool, optional): If enabled, messages in both directions - from 'fromstation' to 'tostation' as well as from 'tostation' to 'fromstation' are returned. Defaults to None.
        * trainnames (Union[str, list], optional): List of train name to be filtered for as a list or as a string separated by comma. Defaults to None.
        * metas (Union[str, list], optional): List of predefined filters as a list or as a string separated by comma. Defaults to None.
        * himcategory (str, optional): HIM category, e.g. Works and/or Disturbance. Value depends on your HAFAS server data. Defaults to None.
        * himtags (Union[str, list], optional): HIM Tags. Value depends on your HAFAS server data. Return HIM messages having these tag(s) only. Multiple values are separated by comma. Note: HIM tags differ from HIM text tags. Defaults to None.
        * regions (Union[str, list], optional): Filter for HIM messages based on regions defined in HAFAS raw data. As a list or as a string separated by comma. Available regions can be retrieved by /datainfo service. Defaults to None.
        * himtext (Union[str, list], optional): Filter for HIM messages containing the given free text message as a list or as a string separated by comma. Defaults to None.
        * himtexttags (Union[str, list], optional): Return HIM texts having this text tag(s) only. Multiple values are separated by comma. Note: HIM text tags differ from HIM tags. Defaults to None.
        * additionalfields (Union[str, list, dict], optional): List of additional fields and values to be filtered for. Two filter options are available: Filter by key only: `additionalfields=key` or filter by key and value: `additionalfields={key:value}`. Multiple filters are separated by comma like `additionalfields=[keyA,keyB]` or `additionalfields={key:value}`. Defaults to None.
        * poly (bool, optional): Enables/disables returning of geo information for affected edges and regions if available and enabled in the backend. Defaults to False.
        * searchmode (Literal["MATCH", "NOMATCH", "TFMATCH"], optional): HIM search mode. `"NOMATCH"` iterate over all HIM messages available. `"MATCH"` iterate over all trips to find HIM messages. `"TFMATCH"` uses filters defined `metas` parameter. Defaults to None.
        * affectedJourneyMode (Literal["ALL", "OFF"], optional): Define how to return affected journeys `"OFF"`: do not return affected journeys. `"ALL"`: return affected journeys. Defaults to None.
        * affectedJourneyStopMode (Literal["ALL", "IMP", "OFF"], optional): Define how to return stops of affected journeys. `"IMP"`: return important stops of affected journeys. `"OFF"`: do not return stops of affected journeys. `"ALL"`: return all affected stops of affected journeys. Defaults to None.
        * orderBy (Union[str, list], optional): Define the Order the returned messages by fields and directions. Multiple, string comma separated or list entries are supported. Read more about this in HAFAS ReST Documentation. Defaults to None.
        * minprio (Union[str, int], optional): Filter for HIM messages having at least this priority. Defaults to None.
        * maxprio (Union[str, int], optional): Filter for HIM messages having this priority as maximum. Defaults to None.

    ### Returns:
        * dict: Output from RMV. Dict will contain "errorCode" and "errorText" if exception occurs.
