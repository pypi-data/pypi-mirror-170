## Installation

Detailed installation and customization instructions are available on the
official [MkDocs Material documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).
Here's a short overview.

Material for MkDocs can be installed with `pip`:

First, make sure you have installed [Python v3.*](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your machine. During the installation you will be asked if you also want to install 'pip'. Do so, and then run the following command to install all the dependencies to run MkDocs on your machine:

```shell
pip install mkdocs-material
```

This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies:
[MkDocs][2], [Markdown][5], [Pygments][6] and [Python Markdown Extensions][7].
Material for MkDocs always strives to support the latest versions, so there's
no need to install those packages separately.
