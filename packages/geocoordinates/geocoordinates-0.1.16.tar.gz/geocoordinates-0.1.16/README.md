# Geographic coordinates coding problem 

Contained is my solution for the geographic coordinates coding problem. There should be the following within this folder:

* The dataset `lla_coordinate_time_series.csv`

* The solution `geo-coordinates.py` file which outputs the two values to stdout

Additionally, there is a much more robust Julia implementation available at the private repository https://github.com/kathesch/GeoCoordinates.jl. This can be imported to any julia repl and is a good showcase of visualizations of this data. E-mail katherinegruenewald@gmail.com with your github information for access.  

## Installation and Running 

1. Open a terminal with the working directory in this file. 
2. Run the following line to activate the virtual environment.
   ```
   source GeoCoordinates/bin/activate
   ```
3. Run the `geo-coordinates.py` script
   ```
   python GeoCoordinatespy
   ```
