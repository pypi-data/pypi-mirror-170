           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# NetCov
NetCov is an open-source tool that can be used with [Batfish](https://github.com/batfish/batfish) to analyze test coverage for network configurations. Given a set of Batfish queries, it analyzes which lines of configurations has/has not been covered. The result can be used to assess the rigorousness of the test suite and help discover the blind spots. Please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.12870.pdf) for technical details.


NetCov is written in Python and can be used in concert with [pybatfish](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/interacting.html), Batfish's Python API.

## Features

NetCov supports coverage tracking for the following [Batfish questions](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/questions.html):

- Reachability test via [traceroute](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/forwarding.html#Traceroute) question
- Routing policy evaluation via [testRoutePolicies](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/routingProtocols.html#Test-Route-Policies) question
- Direct inspection of routing tables via [routes](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/routingTables.html#Routes) and [bgpRib](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/routingTables.html#BGP-RIB) questions


NetCov supports configuration syntax of the following vendors:

|                    | Interface          | BGP neighbor       | Routing Policy     | Prefix list        | Community list     | As-path list       |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Cisco              | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Juniper            | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Arista             | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Palo Alto Networks | :heavy_check_mark: |                    |                    |                    |                    |                    |
| SONiC              |                    | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |


If you’d like support for additional [vendors](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported_devices.html) (which are supported by Batfish but unsupported by NetCov) or currently-unsupported configuration features, let us know via [GitHub issue](https://github.com/UWNetworksLab/netcov/issues). We'll try to add support, and it would help if you share a configuration example. You may want to use an [anonymizer](https://github.com/intentionet/netconan) before sharing.

NetCov reports configuration coverage as the percentage of configuration lines that are covered, such as:

<img src="screenshot_aggregate.png"  width="500">

NetCov can also report fine-grained coverage results as colored annotations on source configurations (lines in blue are covered, lines in red are not covered):

<img src="screenshot_annotation.png"  width="500">

You can find an example of the coverage report [here](https://rawcdn.githack.com/UWNetworksLab/netcov/main/examples/fattree4/coverage/HTML_REPORT/index.html).




## Installing NetCov
Install NetCov using `pip`. A virtual environment and Python version 3.7 is recommended.
```sh
$ pip install netcov
```

NetCov leverages [LCOV](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) to generate HTML report. If you would like to use this feature, install LCOV using Homebrew (MacOS) or apt (Ubuntu):

Install `lcov` on MacOS using Homebrew:
```sh
$ brew install lcov
```
Install `lcov` on Ubuntu using apt:
```sh
$ sudo apt install lcov
```




## Usage
NetCov can be used seamlessly with `pybatfish`. It provides a hooked version of pybatfish APIs that automatically tracks coverage during the execution of supported pybatfish questions. 

### Using NetCov for an existing pybatfish script/notebook

It takes only two simple steps to measure coverage for your existing pybatfish scripts/notebooks.

1. For import, replace pybatfish client session with the one provided by NetCov:
```python
#from pybatfish.client.session import Session
from netcov import NetCovSession as Session
```
2. Generate coverage results at the end of your script. To print coverage metrics to the console, use `bf.cov.result()`. To generate HTML report, use `bf.cov.html_report()`.

### Use NetCov for a new pybatfish script/notebook 

We provide a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcBD2LhxqOQ) and an [example](examples/demo.ipynb) to help you get started. If you are new to pybatfish, we recommend reading the [pybatfish doc](https://pybatfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/interacting.html) first. 


### Advanced

Sometimes not all information retrieved by Batfish questions are meant to be tested, for example, when you retrieve all RIB entries but only assert on a subset of them. To help NetCov model coverage more accurately, you can pause coverage tracking and add tested information use a NetCov API:
```
# pause coverage tracking to avoid over-estimation
bf.cov.pause()
routes = bf.q.routes(nodes="edge-0000").answer().frame()
bf.cov.resume()

# filter RIB entries to test
tested = routes[routes["Network"] == '0.0.0.0/0'].head(1)

# add tested route to coverage trace
bf.cov.add_tested_routes(tested)
```

`bf.cov.result()` prints coverage metrics using `logging` module and writes to `stderr` by default. To save the coverage report to file, you can customize logger by:
```python
import logging
fh = logging.FileHandler('cov.log')
logging.getLogger('netcov').addHandler(fh)
```
