# Map Python versions in GitHub Actions to tox environments to run, for use by

# Get "certifi" to avoid bug #2913. Basically if a `setup_requires=...` causes
# a package to be installed (with setuptools) then it'll fail on certain
# platforms (travis's OX-X 10.12, Slackware 14.2) because PyPI's TLS
# requirements (TLS >= 1.2) are incompatible with the old TLS clients
# available to those systems.  Installing it ahead of time (with pip) avoids
