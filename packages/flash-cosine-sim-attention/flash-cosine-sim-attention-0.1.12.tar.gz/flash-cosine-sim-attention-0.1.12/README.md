## Flash Cosine Similarity Attention

Implementation of fused cosine similarity attention in the same style as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135">Flash Attention</a>. The observation is that by adopting l2 normalized queries and keys, you no longer need to keep track of the row maximums for numerical stability. This greatly simplifies the flash attention algorithm, assuming cosine similarity attention comes at no generalization cost.

In other words, stable, fast, memory efficient, and longer context attention with no downsides.

## Appreciation

- <a href="https://github.com/ahennequ">Arthur Hennequin</a> for coaching me through my first CUDA kernel, and for coding up a simple <a href="https://github.com/ahennequ/pytorch-custom-mma">reference implementation</a>, which helped me to bootstrap the first kernel that comes within reasonable performance to baseline. This work would not have been possible without his expertise.

- <a href="https://github.com/borisdayma">Boris Dayma</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rromb">Robin Rombach</a> for running experiments the simplified cosine sim attention with fixed scaling on some significant text-to-image models and verifying that it indeeds perform just as well as regular attention.

- <a href="https://github.com/MarkusRabe">Markus Rabe</a> for penning the paper that showed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05682">attention does not require O(n¬≤) memory</a>, and <a href="https://tridao.me/">Tri Dao</a> for putting it all together in <a href="https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention">a CUDA kernel implementation for regular attention</a>, demonstrating superiority in speed using the tiled approach minimizing HBM accesses (and for figuring out `dO * O == dP * P` for backwards pass). Would not have been able to complete my pilgrimage looking for the ultimate attention formulation without their discoveries.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install flash-cosine-sim-attention
```

## Usage

Self Attention

```python
import torch
from flash_cosine_sim_attention import flash_cosine_sim_attention

q = torch.randn(1, 8, 1024, 64).cuda()
k = torch.randn(1, 8, 1024, 64).cuda()
v = torch.randn(1, 8, 1024, 64).cuda()

out = flash_cosine_sim_attention(q, k, v)  # (1, 8, 1024, 64)
```

Cross attention

```python
import torch
from flash_cosine_sim_attention import flash_cosine_sim_attention

q = torch.randn(1, 8, 1024, 64).cuda()
k = torch.randn(1, 8, 2048, 64).cuda()
v = torch.randn(1, 8, 2048, 64).cuda()

out = flash_cosine_sim_attention(q, k, v) # (1, 8, 1024, 64)
```

With key / value masking

```python
import torch
from flash_cosine_sim_attention import flash_cosine_sim_attention

q = torch.randn(1, 8, 1024, 64).cuda()
k = torch.randn(1, 8, 2048, 64).cuda()
v = torch.randn(1, 8, 2048, 64).cuda()

mask = torch.ones(1, 2048).bool().cuda()

out = flash_cosine_sim_attention(q, k, v, mask = mask) # (1, 8, 1024, 64)
```

Autoregressive

```python
import torch
from flash_cosine_sim_attention import flash_cosine_sim_attention

q = torch.randn(4, 8, 1024, 64).cuda()
k = torch.randn(4, 8, 1024, 64).cuda()
v = torch.randn(4, 8, 1024, 64).cuda()

out = flash_cosine_sim_attention(q, k, v, causal = True)  # (4, 8, 1024, 64)
```

## Miscellaneous

Single-headed key / values (Shazeer et al & used in PaLM)

```python
import torch
from flash_cosine_sim_attention import flash_cosine_sim_attention

q = torch.randn(4, 8, 1024, 64).cuda()
k = torch.randn(4, 1024, 64).cuda()
v = torch.randn(4, 1024, 64).cuda()

out = flash_cosine_sim_attention(q, k, v, causal = True)  # (4, 8, 1024, 64)
```

If you need to do operations on the queries and keys in between the l2norm and the actual attention step, just set `l2norm_qk = False`

ex.

```python
import torch
from flash_cosine_sim_attention import flash_cosine_sim_attention, l2norm_tensors

q = torch.randn(4, 8, 1024, 64).cuda()
k = torch.randn(4, 1024, 64).cuda()
v = torch.randn(4, 1024, 64).cuda()

q, k = l2norm_tensors(q, k)

# do your rotation of queries and keys
# say with https://github.com/lucidrains/rotary-embedding-torch

out = flash_cosine_sim_attention(q, k, v, l2norm_qk = False)  # (4, 8, 1024, 64)
```

Cross attention with causal works as expected - (caching of keys and values in autoregressive during inference, or transformer-xl like training)

```python
import torch
from flash_cosine_sim_attention import flash_cosine_sim_attention

q = torch.randn(1, 8, 1024, 64).cuda()
k = torch.randn(1, 8, 2048, 64).cuda()
v = torch.randn(1, 8, 2048, 64).cuda()

out = flash_cosine_sim_attention(q, k, v, causal = True) # (1, 8, 1024, 64)
```

If you have batch and head dimensions merged, that is ok

```python
import torch
from flash_cosine_sim_attention import flash_cosine_sim_attention

q = torch.randn(32, 1024, 64).cuda()
k = torch.randn(32, 2048, 64).cuda()
v = torch.randn(32, 2048, 64).cuda()

out = flash_cosine_sim_attention(q, k, v, causal = True) # (32, 1024, 64)
```

## Supported head dimensions

- [x] 32
- [x] 64
- [x] 96
- [x] 128

## Todo

- [ ] bring in a CPU memory efficient version (only for inference, as training does not make sense) using just plain pytorch code
- [ ] support O(n) 1d dynamic positional bias
- [ ] bfloat16 support
- [ ] flexible which type is used for accumulation
- [ ] figure out if dk and dv can be accumulated in half, even if dq cannot, and whether it makes any difference at all
- [ ] allow for flexible definition of whether warp tile atomic adds to float or half
- [ ] figure out how to dispatch differently for architectures (say A100), in case backwards can make use of the increase in shared memory differently
- [ ] allow for other attention tile sizes other than 64x64

- [x] support more standard head dimensions (wip)
- [x] debug and fix bias backwards gradients yet again for head size of 32
- [x] fix attention bias gradients
- [x] allow for single-headed key / values, as in PaLM
- [x] fix atomic add for f16
- [x] attention bias should be able to accept dimensions of an extra batch dimension, for Alphafold2 like attention biasing
- [x] automate cache-busting of kernel using version as suffix to package name
- [x] resolve f16 causal numerical issues
- [x] adopt all learnings from forward kernel to backwards kernel and make sure it outperforms at least on A100

## Description

So far cosine similarity attention is not widely used in industry. The only large model that has been trained with it so far is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09883">SwinV2</a>. If anyone can invalidate the approach, please open an issue or send me an email. You can run experiments against regular attention using the <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers#grouped-query-key-l2-normalization">x-transformers</a> repository.

Update: <a href="https://github.com/borisdayma">Boris Dayma</a> has graciously kicked off <a href="https://wandb.ai/dalle-mini/dalle-mini/reports/Fix-Swin-v2--VmlldzoyNDA4Mzc3">an experiment (blue with red as baseline)</a> to validate cosine similarity attention with a fixed scale of 10 in a real-world model setting. üôè

Update 2: Cosine similarity attention has been proven out in a real-world text-to-image attention network, using a constant scale of `10`. No worse than regular attention. Credit goes to <a href="https://github.com/borisdayma">Boris Dayma</a> for investing the time to run the experiment and removing doubts surrounding the technique.

Update 3: <a href="https://github.com/rromb">Robin Rombach</a> has tested out the kernel in this repository with head size of 64 and fixed scale of 10 in a text-to-image model, observing no difference from regular attention. More evaluations pending.

Update 4: The improvement in performance seen in Boris' experiments are likely due to the fact that cosine-sim attention allows for one to switch from pre layernorm to post layernorm configuration in the transformers (as the l2norm effectively takes the place of the pre-layernorm). Cosine sim attention will likely yield results the same as regular attention, without any other changes to the transformer.

## Testing

For testing output and gradients are equal for non-autoregressive and autoregressive scenarios

```bash
$ python setup.py test
```

## Benchmarking

Make sure to first install the CUDA kernel

```python
$ python setup.py install
```

Then

```python
$ python benchmark.py
```

For only benchmarking forwards or backwards, append either `--only-forwards` or `--only-backwards` flag to the above. To benchmark autoregressive, append `--causal`

## Training a small GPT on Enwik8

```bash
$ make train
```

Try 8192 sequence length. It'll be slow but will work (normal attention will break at > 2048, you'll see this if you remove the `--use-cuda-kernel` flag)

```python
$ python train.py --seq-len 8192 --use-cuda-kernel
```
