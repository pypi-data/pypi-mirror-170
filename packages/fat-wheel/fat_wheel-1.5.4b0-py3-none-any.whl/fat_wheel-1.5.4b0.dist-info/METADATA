Fat Wheel are basically wheels which include dependencies inside whl/tar/egg distribution
similar in java we build a fat jar and run app from jar which have deps in inside the jar
Fat Wheel try to solve to problems.

1. you just build the fat-wheel and install and run it
2. as dist have same deps inside when built and same deps install on use site
3. share code and install deps when have no internet connection(which is not a problem today ;-))


Usage
*****

1. install fat-wheel

.. code-block:: text

    pip install fat-wheel

2. run ``fat <project_path>`` in cmd and run it project root dir and press enter

    * open cli in project root and run

    ::

        fat .


    * view help options

    ::

        fat -h

3. it will generate a local copy of project with deps and build whl/sdist/ dist
4. use whl/tar dist and install
5. it will install and create a cli command, command name is same as root_pkg name
   when run this cli command it will install deps locally not from any repo
6. **please look into build project copy and its setup.py for cli command name**

not supported yet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. currently only support flat-layout means root pkg in project root dir

::

    project-root-dir
     |
     |--pkg
     |   |--__init__.py
     |   |....
     |....


2. egg file able to build error in install
3. ***still in development may or may not support it***
