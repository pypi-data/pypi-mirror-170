# Mass Edit Word Documents But Keep Original Formatting.

Edit existing Word documents effortlessly and without changing the original formatting of the document. As great as the original `docx` library is, this "keep same format" feature is not natively supported. However, this functionality is pretty useful if you want to automate document writing or editing and need to adhere to strict formatting rules. Hence, I wrote this add-on module.

With pip: `pip install docxedit`

## Dependencies

Included as a dependency: `python-docx`
