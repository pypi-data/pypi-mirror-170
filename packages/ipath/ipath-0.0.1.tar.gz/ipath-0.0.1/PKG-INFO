Description: # ipath
        apollo path and simple map making tool
        
        ## Draw path
        We can use below cmd draw path from cyber_record
        ```
        cyber_record echo -f example.record.00000 -t /apollo/localization/pose | ipath
        ```
        
        #### Save path
        Since it is time-consuming to read the location information from the record file, we can save it to file add `-s`, which is saved to the local `path.txt ` by default.
        ```
        cyber_record echo -f example.record.00000 -t /apollo/localization/pose | ipath -s
        ```
        
        ## Draw from file
        After saving path.txt you can read directly from it and draw the path.
        ```
        ipath -i path.txt
        ```
