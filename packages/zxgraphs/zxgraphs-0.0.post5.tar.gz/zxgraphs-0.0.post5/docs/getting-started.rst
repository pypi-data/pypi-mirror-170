Getting Started
===============

ZX graphs are a graph-theoretic tool to represent quantum circuits and computations in terms of computational basis (Z basis) and Fourier basis (X basis) tensors (known to us as "spiders") for finite Abelian group algebras.

ZX graphs are currently in pre-alpha development.
Once development is complete, you will be able to install the latest release from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/zxgraphs/>`_ as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install --upgrade zxgraphs
