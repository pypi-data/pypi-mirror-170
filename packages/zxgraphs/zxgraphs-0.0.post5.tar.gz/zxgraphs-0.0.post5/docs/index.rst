
zxgraphs: A Python implementation of ZX graphs for quantum computing.
=====================================================================

ZX graphs are a graph-theoretic tool to represent quantum circuits and computations in terms of computational basis (Z basis) and Fourier basis (X basis) tensors (known to us as "spiders") for finite Abelian group algebras.
