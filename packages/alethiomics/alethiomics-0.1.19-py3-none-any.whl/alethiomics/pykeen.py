    """Predict novel links in a Knowledge Graph from lists of heads/relations/tails. The main difference from pykeen.models.predict.get_prediction_df is that this function can work with lists.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model: object of pykeen.models class
        Embedding model used when running a pykeen pipeline.
    training: object of pykeen.triples.triples_factory.TriplesFactory class
        An object containing a training set corpredictionsponding to a dataset on which a model was trained.
    heads: list of strings
        List of graph heads.
    relations: list of strings
        List of graph relations.
    tails: list of strings
        List of graph tails.

    Returns
    -------
    predictions_all: pandas DataFrame
        A pandas DataFrame containing pykeen prediciton results plus two extra columns: either head/tail, head/relation or relation/tail, depending on what was provided as an input.
