# PyTorch Geometric Multi-Agent

[Documentation](https://pytorch-geometric-multiagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

-----------------------
The official repo for the CoRL 2022 paper 'Learning Control Admissibility Models with Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Agent Navigation' ([project page](https://rainorangelemon.github.io/CoRL2022/))

The current repo only includes GNN for control. For planning methods such as CBS and SIPP, please stay tuned.

The current repo is actively under maintenance. The ultimate goal is to provide a benchmark and a handy tool for GNN researchers to conduct evaluations properly and fairly for multi-agent tasks.
