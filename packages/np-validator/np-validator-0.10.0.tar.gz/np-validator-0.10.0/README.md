`np-validator` is just a simple Python cli/package that validates data sources for the neuropixel pipline using templated workflows.

</div>

## Quick overview

### API

#### Auto-generated steps

By default `run_validation` can be run on a list of
filepaths. A list of `ValidationStep` will be auto-generated if a valid project name is supplied.
_If no project name is supplied project name will be "default"._

```python
from np_validator import run_validation

filepaths = [
  "some/sort/of/path/prefix/uuid-maybe.mapping.pkl",
  "some/sort/of/path/prefix/uuid-maybe.behavior.pkl",
  "this/will/be/ignored/uuid-maybe.replay.pkl",
]

results = run_validation(filepaths, project="default")
```

Manually generating validation steps

```python
from np_validator import Processor, Validator, ValidationStep, run_validation

# make a basic filesize validator
fs_validator = Validator(
  name="meets_filesize_threshold",
  args={
    "threshold": 10,
  },
)

# add validator to a validation step
validation_step_0 = ValidationStep(
  path_suffix=".mapping.pkl",
  validators=[fs_validator, ],
)

# make a validation step with a processor
# processors convert the data source from it's basic state, a filepath, to an easier to use object

# unpickle, unpickles an arbitrary filepath into a python object
unpickler = Processor(
  name="unpickle",
)

# has_dict_key, checks if a dict-like interface has a key at path
session_uuid_validator = Validator(
  name="has_dict_key",
  args={
    "path": ["session_uuid", ],
  }
)

# assembling it all together as a validation step

validation_step_1 = ValidationStep(
  path_suffix=".behavior.pkl",
  processor=unpickler,
  validators=[session_uuid_validator, ],
)

# running a validation
filepaths = [
  "some/sort/of/path/prefix/uuid-maybe.mapping.pkl",
  "some/sort/of/path/prefix/uuid-maybe.behavior.pkl",
  "this/will/be/ignored/uuid-maybe.replay.pkl",
]
results = run_validation(
  filepaths,
  [validation_step_0, validation_step_1, ],
)
```

Updating autogenerated steps

```python
from np_validator import Processor, Validator, ValidationStep, autogenerate_validation_steps, update_project_validation_steps

# autogenerated steps are organized by projects
validation_step_0 = ValidationStep(
  path_suffix=".mapping.pkl",
  validators=[
    Validator(
      name="meets_filesize_threshold",
      args={
        "threshold": 10,
      },
    ),
  ],
)

validation_step_1 = ValidationStep(
  path_suffix=".behavior.pkl",
  processor=Processor(
    name="unpickle",
  ),
  validators=[
    Validator(
      name="has_dict_key",
      args={
        "path": ["session_uuid", ],
      }
    ),
  ],
)

# updating project validation steps overwrites the previous steps

update_project_validation_steps(
  "pretest",  # project name
  [validation_step_0, validation_step_1],
)

# to append, get the current steps with autogenerate_validation_steps and append to it
current = autogenerate_validation_steps("default")
updated = current + [validation_step_0, validation_step_1]
update_project_validation_steps(
  "default",  # project name
  updated, # append new steps
)
```

## Documentation

For more detailed documentation on using this package please refer to the [docs](https://alleninstitute.github.io/np_validator/).

## Contributing

### Processor

To add a new processor, add the function to `np_validator/processors.py`. Ideally create a test for it in `tests`. Run the _tests_\* to help ensure that no regressions have been introduced. Each processor is expected to have one required argument which is expected to be a string filepath.

### Validator

To add a new validator, add the function to `np_validator/validators.py`. Ideally create a test for it in `tests`. Run the _tests_\* to help ensure that no regressions have been introduced.

\*_Tests automatically run on pull_request\._

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U np-validator
```

or install with `Poetry`

```bash
poetry add np-validator
```

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/np_validator/np-validator/blob/master/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Download and remove Poetry</summary>
<p>

To download and install Poetry run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

To uninstall

```bash
make poetry-remove
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `pyupgrade`, `isort` and `black`.

```bash
make codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `isort`, `black` and `darglint` library

Update all dev libraries to the latest version using one comand

```bash
make update-dev-deps
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Code security</summary>
<p>

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Type checks</summary>
<p>

Run `mypy` static type checker

```bash
make mypy
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to ~~rule~~ run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make test && make check-codestyle && make mypy && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```

More information [about docker](https://github.com/np_validator/np-validator/tree/master/docker).

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. Cleanup</summary>
<p>
Delete pycache files

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

Remove package build

```bash
make build-remove
```

Delete .DS_STORE files

```bash
make dsstore-remove
```

Remove .mypycache

```bash
make mypycache-remove
```

Or to remove all above run:

```bash
make cleanup
```
