# Rugosa

The next generation of [kordesii](https://github.com/Defense-Cyber-Crime-Center/kordesii). 
This is a library (not a framework) for managing emulation and provides utilities 
for interfacing with decompiled malware samples using [dragodis](https://github.com/Defense-Cyber-Crime-Center/dragodis).

Rugosa is meant to be used with an automation framework such as [DC3-MWCP](https://github.com/Defense-Cyber-Crime-Center/DC3-MWCP),
but can also be used in one-off scripting.


## Install

```
pip install rugosa
```

You will also need to setup a backend disassembler by following [Dragodis's installation instructions](https://github.com/Defense-Cyber-Crime-Center/dragodis/blob/master/docs/install.rst).

The following utilities are included with Rugosa:
