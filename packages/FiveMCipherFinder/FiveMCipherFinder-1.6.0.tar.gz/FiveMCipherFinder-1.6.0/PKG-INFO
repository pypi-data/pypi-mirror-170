# FivemCipherFinder (v1.5.0)
[![Pylint](https://github.com/exersalza/FivemCipherFinder/actions/workflows/pylint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/exersalza/FivemCipherFinder/actions/workflows/pylint.yml)

This is a Fivem Cipher remover for those that don't want Ciphers in their scripts :D

The idea behind these scripts are to remove a Cipher or more. Currently, there is it only in Python available, but I will soon add the C++ variant.

Desc:
The script will walk through your Servers directory's and scan for as example `\x41\x42\x43`. When it found something.

## Languages 
Planed are Python (Finished so far) and C++ (Not started)


## Install instructions for Python
Py-Version: 3.7 and above

Clone or Download the latest release and unpack it.

The `finder.py` is your entry point, you can run it with `find-cipher <Your Path> [Exclude Path]`. 
You can also just use the file as `Your Path` to scan only one file. `Exclude Path` is not requiered.

With the exclude path parameter, you can add one or more paths that shall be excluded (anticheat or anticheat, cars).

The script with the Ciphers getting logged in a File (`CipherLog.txt`) that gets created.
