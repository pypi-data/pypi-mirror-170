*One Hyper-Tasking Transformer can be creative as DALL-E and GPT-3 and smart as CLIP*

---

**RU**ssian **D**ecoder **O**n **L**anguage **P**icture **H**yper-tasking (**RUDOLPH**) is a text-image-text transformer designed for an easy fine-tuning for a range of tasks: from generating images by text description and image classification to visual question answering and more. This model demonstrates the power of Hyper-tasking Transformers.

*Hyper-tasking model is a generalized multi-tasking model, i.e., the model that can solve almost all tasks within supported modalities, mandatory including mutual pairwise translations between modalities (two modalities in case of RUDOLPH: images and Russian texts).*
