# Gymnasium-Robotics
A collection of robotics simulation environments for reinforcement learning based on the [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) physics engine, and first introduced in the following [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09464).

Requirements:
- Python 3.7 to 3.10
- Gymnasium v0.26
- NumPy 1.18+
- Mujoco 2.2.2

If you use these environments, please cite the following paper:

## New MuJoCo Python Bindings

The latest version and future versions of the MuJoCo environments will no longer depend on `mujoco-py`. Instead the new [mujoco](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html) python bindings will be the required dependency for future gymnasium MuJoCo environment versions. Old gymnasium MuJoCo environment versions that depend on `mujoco-py` will still be kept but unmaintained.
Dependencies for old MuJoCo environments can still be installed by `pip install gymnasium_robotics[mujoco_py]`.
