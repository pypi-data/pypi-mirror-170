# Description.
Defines and plots the slope surface tarrain as an open polygon. The
polygon is stored on a list, in which each element is a dictionary type
line structure.

# External sub-function(s):
create2dsegmentstructure.

# Input(s).
Vector that connects the toe with global coordinate system origin
(fromToeOriginRowVec). Obtained with materialboundary function.

Height of the slope (slopeHeight)

Slope dip, given by a 1x2 vector which represents a horizontal distance and
a vertical distance not necesary representing the real slope distances
[horzDist, vertDist], (slopeDip).

Crown horizontal distance (crownDist).

Toe horizontal distance (toeDist).

Logical value put as 'True' or 'False' if it is wanted to plot. Default 
value is 'False' (want2plot).

# Output(s).
One list that stores all the lines conforming the surface
polyline (surfaceDataCell), in which each element is a dictionary type
line structure. Each line has the following fields:
      iniPtVec: vector of the coordinates of the first line point;
      endPtVec: vector of the coordinates of the second line point;
      unitVec: unit vector that defines a direction;
      lambda: value that defines the segment length;
      slope: value that defines the slope of the line equation of the
             segment; 
      azimuthRad: counter-clockwise angle (in radians) from a reference
              axis of [1, 0] to [0, 1];
      intercept: value that defines the intercept of line equation of the 
              segment.

Coordinates of the slope terrain polyline given in a nx2 array
(surfaceChordsArray).

# Example:
By putting the following input variables obtained with materialboundary 
function:

slopeHeight = 12; slopeDip = np.array([1, 2.5]); crownDist = 10.0;\
toeDist = 10.0; fromToeOriginRowVec = np.array([-14.8, -3.30])
 
The first element of the surfaceDataCell list is the dictionary as follows:
{'azimuthRad': 0.0,
  'endPtVec': array([-19.6,   8.7]),
  'iniPtVec': array([-29.6,   8.7]),
  'intercept': 8.6999999999999993,
  'lambda': 10.0,
  'slope': 0.0,
  'unitVec': array([ 1.,  0.])}
