# Description.
Given a 2x1 vector, this function obtains the angle of the azimuth from
x-axis in a counter clockwise sense.
Coordiante system is with x in the abscisas and y in the ordinates  (i.e. 
x horizontal pointing to the right and y vertical pointing upwards).

# Input(s).
Array that representing a bi-dimensional vector (vector).

# Output(s).
Angle in radians representing the azimut of the vector (angleRad).
 
Example: giving next array
vector = np.array([3,-5]), is obtined  5.2528 radians

angleRad = azimuthangle(vector)
