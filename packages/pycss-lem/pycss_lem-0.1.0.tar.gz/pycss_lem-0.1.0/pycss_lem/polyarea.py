# Description.
determine the area of a simple polygon whose vertices are described by 
ordered pairs in the plane based on Gauss's area formula.

# Input(s).
1xn vector with x-coordinates of the polygon (xCoord).

1xn vector with y-coordinates of the polygon (yCoord).

# Output(s):
polygon area (area)

# Example1: by giving next values
xCoord = np.arange(1,10)
yCoord = xCoord**2

is obtained: area = 84.0

---
 area = polyarea(xCoord, yCoord)
