Description.
Function used to compute the center of the circle given two points and a
radius. Takes only real inputs and gives only real outputs.
Function originally named: circ_cent.m for MatLab(R)

# Input(s):
First circle point (pt1Vec).

Second circle point (pt2Vec).

Circle radius (radius).

# Output(s):
Row vector of the point where the first possible center (centerVec1);

Row vector of the point where the second possible center (centerVec2).

# Example1:
pt1Vec = np.array([40, 12]); pt2Vec = np.array([4.347, 24]); radius = 34.4848
One of the solutions is: np.array([31.3936, 45.3936]).
