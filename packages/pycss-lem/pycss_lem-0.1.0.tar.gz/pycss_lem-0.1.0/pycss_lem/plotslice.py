# Description.
Plot one slide from its structure.

# Input(s).
Slices dictionary type structures (slicesSTRCell). Has the following fields:
    plineCords: contains all the coordiantes that gives the
      slice closed polyline;
    area: slice polygon area;
    midPoint: coordinates of the middle point of the slice at its base;
    midHeight: value of the mean height taken the initial,
      middle and end heights of the slice at its base to terrain surface;
    width: value of width slice;
    inclinationAngleGradAtBottom: angle in sexagesimal grades of the
      secant line that passess trough the extreme borders of the bottom slice;
    inclinationAngleGradAtTop: angle in sexagesimal grades of the
      secant line that passess trough the extreme borders of the top slice;
    wtMidHeight: value of the mean height taken the initial,
      middle and end heights of the slice at its base to watertable surface;
    wtMidHeightAboveSlope: value of the mean height taken the initial,
      middle and end heights of the water column above slope surface;
    hrzMomentArm: value of the horizontal component of the moment arm acting 
      on the slope due to the water above it;
    vrtMomentArm: value of the vertical component of the moment arm acting 
      on the slope due to the water above it;

# Output(s).
Array containing the coordinates of the slice contourn
(slicePlineCordsArray).
