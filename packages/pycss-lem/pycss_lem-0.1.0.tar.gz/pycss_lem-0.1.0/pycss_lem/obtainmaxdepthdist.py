# Description.
With the extreme points of the defined slope, this function obtains the
lower possible boundary in where a slip circle can be, i.e. obtains the
maximum depth computed from the slope toe.

# Input(s).
Height of the slope (slopeHeight).

Slope dip, can be given by an angle in gradians, angle in radians, a
horizontal distance value relative to a unitary vertical distance (i.e.
horz:1), or a bidimensional vector which represents a horizontal distance and
a vertical distance that not necessary representing the real slope distances 
[horzDist, vertDist], (slopeDip).

Crown horizontal plane distance (crownDist).

Toe horizontal plane distance (toeDist).

# Output(s):
Vertical distance from the slide--toe to downwards (toeDepth).

# Example1: By giving next values:
slopeHeight = 12; slopeDip = np.array([2.5, 1]); crownDist = 10.0;\
toeDist = 10.0; it is obtained a toeDepth = 14.44.
