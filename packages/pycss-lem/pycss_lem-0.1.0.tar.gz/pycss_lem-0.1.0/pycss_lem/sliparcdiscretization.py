# Description.
Obtains the coordiantes and also plots the arc that forms the slip
surface, knowing the points at crown and toe, number of slices and
slip arc structure obtained previously with 'defineslipcircle' function. The
segment arc is represented as a polyline, therefore one should give the
number of segments the arc may de divided, but it is recommended to be
equal to the number of slices in future calculations.

# External sub-function(s): none.

# Input(s).
Two dimensional vector of the coordinates that defines the slip at the
slope toe (pointAtToeVec);

Two dimensional vector of the coordinates that defines the slip at the
slope crown (pointAtCrownVec);

Number of polylines that defines the arc (nDivs).

Dictionary type structure of the arc that defines the slip (slipArcSTR). 

Boolean value of true if a plot of the resulting arc is wanted. Default value
is False (want2plot).

# Output(s).
A n x 2 array that represents the coordiantes of the points that defines
the slip arc (arcPointsCoordsArray).

# Example1:
pointAtToeVec = np.array([23, 3.3]); pointAtCrownVec = np.array([2, 15.3])
nDivs = 6; want2plot = True;
