# Description.
Defines and plots the boundary of the material were the slope stability
analysis will be immersed. The analysis will be performed only in slopes
which faces to the right (i.e. slip to the right in a counter clockwise
sense). Also, this function only creates a standard slope: horizontal
surfaces behind the crown and below the foot of the slope. The boundary
is defined therefore by the slope height and the slope inclination and
the two horizontal distances.

# External sub-function(s):
obtainmaxdepthdist.

# Input(s).
Height of the slope (slopeHeight).

Slope dip, given by a bidimensional vector which represents a vertical 
distance and a horizontal distance that not necesary representing the real 
slope distances [horzDist,vertDist], (slopeDip).

Crown horizontal plane distance (crownDist).

Toe horizontal plane distance (toeDist).

Logical value put as 'True' or 'False' if it is wanted to plot. Default 
value is 'False' (want2plot).

# Output(s):
Contour coordinates of the material boundary given in a n x 2 array
(boundPointsCordsArray).

Row vector that specifies this coordinate system origin problem relative
to the slip toe (fromToeOriginRowVec).

Coordinate system transformation matrix of 2x2 size (coordTransMat).
The reference system of points coordinates are the left bottom side.

# Example1: by giving next values
slopeHeight = 12; slopeDip = np.array([1, 2.5]); crownDist = 10.0;\
toeDist = 10.0; it is obtained:
 
boundPointsCordsArray =    |    fromToeOrginRowVec = array([14.8, 3.30])
(array([[  0.  ,   0.  ],  |    
        [ 24.8 ,   0.  ],  |    coordTransMat = array([[1, 0],
        [ 24.8 ,   3.3 ],  |                           [0, 1]])
