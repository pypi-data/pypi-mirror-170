# Description.
Creates a two-dimensional line segment structure from their initial and
final points. It returns a dictionary type segment structure.

# External sub-function(s):
azimuthangle, unitvector.

# Input(s):
Array type two-dimensional vector, that represents the segment initial point
relative to a coordinate system (iniPnt2dRowVec);

Array type two-dimensional vector, that represents the segment end point 
relative to a coordinate system (endPnt2dRowVec); 

# Output(s):
Dictionary type segment structure (segmentSTR) with the following fields:
      iniPtVec: vector of the coordinates of the first line point;
      endPtVec: vector of the coordinates of the second line point;
      unitVec: unit vector that defines a direction;
      lambda: value that defines the segment length;
      slope: value that defines the slope of the line equation of the
             segment; 
      azimuthRad: counter-clockwise angle (in radians) from a reference
              axis of [1, 0] to [0, 1];
      intercept: value that defines the intercept of line equation of the 
              segment.

# Example1.
These two points defines a two dimensional segment
  iniPnt2dRowVec = np.array([53.8973, 43.2314])
  endPnt2dRowVec = np.array([69.0489, 50.5464])
the the segment values are as following:
      iniPtVec: [53.8973 43.2314]
       endPtVec: [69.0489 50.5464]
        unitVec: [0.9005 0.4348]
         lambda: 16.8250
          slope: 0.4828
     azimuthRad: 0.4498
      intercept: 17.2105
