# Description.
Given an array of two columns (n x 2), the function extracts unique row
values that are not necessarily and strictly equal among other rows; the
desition is governed by a tolerance value.

# Input(s).
Array of n x 2 of dimension (array).

Number that will define the tolerance of the selection criterium (tolerance).

# Output(s).
New array with unique rows (uniqueArray).

# Example:
Given the following array:
array = np.array([\
   [ 9.   ,  2.   ],
   [ 7.   ,  4.123],
   [ 5.   ,  6.129],
   [ 7.   ,  8.12 ],
   [ 0.   ,  1.1  ],
   [ 9.001,  2.   ]])
it's obtained:
array([[ 0.   ,  1.1  ],
       [ 5.   ,  6.129],
       [ 7.   ,  4.123],
       [ 7.   ,  8.12 ],
       [ 9.   ,  2.   ]])
