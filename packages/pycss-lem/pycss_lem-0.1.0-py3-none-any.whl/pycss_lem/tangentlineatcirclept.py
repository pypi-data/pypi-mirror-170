tangentlineatcirclept means: 'tangent--line at circle point'

# Description.
Calculates a line that is tangent to a specificed point that belongs to a
circular arc. The code verifies if the point belongs to the circular arc
equation (i.e. the circle), and tolerates some points that could be
closer to the circle by recalculating the y coordianted based on the x
coordinate of the point. If the point belongs to the circle of the arc, it
verfies if that point is betwwen the limits that defines the arc.

# External sub-function(s): unitvector, azimuthangle.

# Input(s).
Two-dimensional vector that defines the point that belongs to the circle
(atCirclePointVec);

Structure of an circular arc from which the circle belongs and at which
the tanget line is wanted to obtain (slipCircleSTR). It's obtained previously
with 'defineslipcircle' function. This structure has the following fields:
    center: center of the slip arc;
    radius: radius of the slip arc;
    iniAngGrad: counter clockwise angle (in sexagesimal grades)
        from a reference unit vector [1 0] to the initial radius that
        defines the arc;
    endAngGrad: counter clockwise angle (in sexagesimal grades)
        from a reference unit vector [1 0] to the final radius that
        defines the arc;
    deepDist: deepest distance from toe--point horizontal
        reference where the arc passes;
    leftDist: most left distance from toe--point vertical
        reference where the arc passes;

# Output(s).
Boolean variable with a true value if the given point is inside the
circular arc (isPtBetweenArcLimitsTrue).

Structure of an infinite line (tangentLineSTR). The following fields forms
this structure:
  refPtVec
  unitVec
  slope
  nearestAzimuthAngRad
  farestAzimuthAngRad
  intercept
Among the fields of this structure, some of them are easy to understand;
but the nearesAzimuthAngRad is the angle of the azimuth (given in radians)
of the tangent sense that is nearest to the reference vector [1 0] when
turning couterclockwise sense.
Then the 'farestAzimuthAngRad' is a similar azimuth angle of the oposite
tangent sense.
