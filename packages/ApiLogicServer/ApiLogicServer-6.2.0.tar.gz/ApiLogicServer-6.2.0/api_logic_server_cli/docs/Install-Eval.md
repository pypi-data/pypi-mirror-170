The fastest way to explore API Logic Server - *with __no install__* - is to follow this [Exploration Guide](#exploration-guide) to create, explore and customize a project.

!!! Caution "Requires Codespaces Beta, or in organization with Codespaces enabled"
    There are currently restrictions on Codespaces usage.  It appears these will be [removed in the near future](https://github.com/community/community/discussions/32791){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

If you are new to API Logic Server, the following section provides a brief overview.

&nbsp;

# Why: Partial Automation, Proprietary IDEs

We saw __shortfalls in current approaches__ for building database systems:

* __Frameworks: too slow -__ _multi-endpoint APIs_ and _multi-page apps_ would require _weeks_ in frameworks such as Flask or Django, since it's all code -- no automation

* __Low Code Tools: no backend automation, proprietary IDEs__ - good UI automation, but none for backend business logic (nearly half the effort), and often do not leverage existing IDEs (VSCode, PyCharm, etc).

&nbsp;

# Instant, Full System Automation, Leverage Existing Tools
So, we created API Logic Server as an __open source__ Python project: a __CLI__ for project creation, and a set of __execution runtimes.__  Install with a standard Python (`pip`) install or Docker.<br/><br/>

## Project Creation is Instant: Single Command
 
**Create** a project with `ApiLogicServer create`; **run** it with `python api_logic_server_run.py`.


## Projects are Highly Functional: Admin UI and API
API Logic Server reads your schema, and creates an  __executable__ project:

* __API__ - an endpoint for each table, with filtering, sorting, pagination and related data access

* __Admin UI__ - multi-page / multi-table apps, with page navigations and automatic joins<br/><br/>

## Projects are Customizable: Using _Your_ IDE

Customize projects in __your IDE__ (VSCode, PyCharm, etc.) for edit, debug and code management.<br/> <br/>


## Business Logic is Automated: Unique Rules :trophy: 

Declare business logic with spreadsheet-like rules (40x more concise than code), extensible with Python.

# Exploration Guide

Use these instructions to run API Logic Server in the cloud (courtesy Codespaces) - create a project, run it, and customize it using VSCode.

&nbsp;

## Open in Codespaces

Explore API Logic Server running under CodeSpaces as follows.

__1. Use your GitHub account__ - you may need to sign-up for the Beta, or be in a Codespaces-enabled organization

__2. Load this project from GitHub, and create the Sample__

To load this GitHub project with Codespaces:

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a. [Open this page in a ___new window___](https://github.com/ApiLogicServer/ApiLogicProject), and 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. Click __Code > Codespaces__ as shown below
   <figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/apilogicserver/wiki/images/git-codespaces/open-on-codespaces.jpg?raw=true"></figure> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; __c. You will see an empty project - running in VSCode, _in the Browser_.__   
   > But that's just what you _see..._ <br/><br/>
   > Behind the scenes, Codespaces has requisitioned a cloud machine, and loaded your project - with a _complete development environment_ - Python, your dependencies, git, etc.<br/>  
   > You are attached to this machine in your Browser, running VSCode.<br/><br/>
   > :trophy: Pretty remarkable.<br/><br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; __d. Create the Sample__

To create the sample, paste the following into the terminal window:<br/>

```
ApiLogicServer create --project_name=./ --db_url=
```

where:

   * `project_name` is specified to be the current directory (normally a new directory)
   * `db_url` is specified as the sample (normally a SQLAlchemy URI to your own database)
   
Do not rebuild the container if requested.<br/><br/>

__3. Add and Configure a Port__

Referring to the figure below (steps 3-5), click the __Ports__ tab, and:

* Add the Port (5656)
* Make the port __public__ (use right-click to alter the Visibility)

<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/apilogicserver/wiki/images/git-codespaces/create-port-launch-simple.jpg?raw=true"></figure>
<br/>

__4. Start the Server__

* Click __Run/Debug__ on the left toolbar
* Use the pre-defined Launch Configuration - click the green __run__ button<br/><br/>

__5. Start the Browser__

* Click the globe (on the Ports tab), as shown below.  This should start your Browser, and the links on the left (Customer etc) should return data.

!!! note "If the Browser fails to load"
    Stop / restart the Server.

<details markdown>
<summary>Alternate Procedure using Codespaces-ApiLogicServer Launch Configuration</summary>

The above procedure is simplified, based on some assumptions about forwarded ports in Codespaces.  If the Browser fails to launch even when after restarting the server, you can explicitly specify the forwarded port:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/valhuber/apilogicserver/wiki/images/git-codespaces/create-port-launch.png?raw=true"></figure>
<br/>
__4. Configure the pre-created `Codespaces-ApiLogicServer` launch configuration__ (see above)

__5. Start the Server__ using the provided Launch Configuration = `Codespaces-ApiLogicServer`

__6. Open the Browser__

Click the globe, as shown above.  This should start your Browser, and the links on the left (Customer etc) should return data.

## Run the Tutorial

The Tutorial will enable you to explore 2 key aspects:

* __Initial Automation__ - API and UI creation are automated from the data model. So, later, you'd see this level of automation for your own databases.

* __Customization and Debugging__ - this sample also includes customizations for extending the API and declaring logic, and how to use VSCode to debug these.  The Tutorial will clearly identify such pre-built customizations.

Now, [open the Tutorial](Tutorial.md).
