    'long_description': '# Receipt Scanner\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall using pip!\n\n```sh\npip install receipt-scanner\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### As a package\n\nAfter installation, you can import the `scan` method from the library. Just pass the image location (it can be a local path or a URL), an optional regular expression to filter the parsed text and the optional `debug` parameter:\n\n```py\nimport re\nfrom receipt_scanner import scan\n\nexpression = re.compile("([0-9]+\\.[0-9]+)")\nscanned_text_lines = scan(\n    "path/to/some/image.jpg",\n    regular_expression=expression,\n    debug=True,\n)\n```\n\nThe `scan` method returns a list of strings for each text line that the regular expression matched. If no regular expression gets passed, every parsed text line will be returned.\n\n### As a CLI\n\nYou can also use `receipt-scanner` as a CLI! Once installed, the `scanner` command will be available. Here is a sample usage:\n\n```sh\nscanner --image path/to/some/image.jpg --expression "([0-9]+\\.[0-9]+)" --debug\n```\n\n### Debugging\n\nThe `debug` flag will show logs of every step, and will freeze each image manipulation step to show the result of said manipulation. This can be useful to understand why the `scan` command might be returning an empty list, for example (you might find that the image has poor contrast and that the contour of the receipt is not being correctly mapped).\n\n## Developing\n\n### Requirements\n\n- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)\n- [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html)\n- [Teseract Spanish](https://parzibyte.me/blog/2019/05/18/instalar-tesseract-ocr-idioma-espanol-ubuntu)\n\n### Steps\n\nClone the repository:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/daleal/receipt-scanner.git\n\ncd receipt-scanner\n```\n\nThen, recreate the environment:\n\n```sh\nmake build-env\n```\n\nOnce the package is installed for development (`poetry install`), you can use the CLI from the virtualenv.\n\n## Aknowledgements\n\nMost of the code from this project was adapted from StackOverflow answers to questions about contour-finding, denoising and stuff like that. I also used code from several guides from the internet for utilities such as transforming a contour to a rect. Without those answers, most of this library would have been impossible for me to write. Thanks for the awesome information! ðŸ’–\n',
