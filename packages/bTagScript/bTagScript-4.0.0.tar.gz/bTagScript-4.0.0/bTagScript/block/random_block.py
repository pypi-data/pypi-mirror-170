class RandomBlock(verb_required_block(True, payload=True)):
    """
    Pick a random item from a list of strings, split by either ``~``
    or ``,``. An optional seed can be provided to the parameter to
    always choose the same item when using that seed.
    You can weight options differently by adding a weight and | before
    the item.

    **Usage:** ``{random([seed]):<list>}``

    **Aliases:** ``#, rand``

    **Payload:** ``list``

    **Parameter:** ``seed``

    **Examples:**

    .. tagscript::

        {random:Carl,Harold,Josh} attempts to pick the lock!
        Possible Outputs:
        Josh attempts to pick the lock!
        Carl attempts to pick the lock!
        Harold attempts to pick the lock!

        {=(insult):{#:{insults}}}
        {insult}
        Assigns a random insult to the insult variable
