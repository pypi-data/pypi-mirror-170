## Benchmarks (Performance Testing)

### July 08, 2022

Testing for this benchmark used the following seeds and test strings, this was ran `1,000` times.

```yaml
Seeds: {message: Hello, this is my message.}
Test String: {message} {#:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} {range:1-9} {$variablename:Hello World} {variablename} {message} {strf:Its %A}
```

Note that this was adjusted for different syntax, {=(variablename):Hello World} vs {$variablename:Hello World}

bTagScript will likely get worse and worse as more blocks are added...
