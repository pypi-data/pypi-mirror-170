### Disclaimer

This project has been specifically coded for the Quaker Meeting House Heritage Project, both in hard-coded variables, and hard-coded parameters for extracting text. It is a tool to suit a very specific use-case and may not work if used otherwise. The project further depends on the files required being listed online at the URLs provided. If Britain Yearly Meeting takes down the website and associated pdfs, back-ups are available on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The code can also be adapted to work with locally downloaded pdfs. go to Appendix: Hosting Errors to note the required changes. 

## Installation

    pip install quakerheritage


## How-To Use

Simply run the following command:

    python -m quakerheritage.build

You will be prompted to select a location for the csv output to be placed. Once chosen, the code will run quietly in the background until complete, and the csv available at your chosen directory as 'quakerHeritageDB.csv'
