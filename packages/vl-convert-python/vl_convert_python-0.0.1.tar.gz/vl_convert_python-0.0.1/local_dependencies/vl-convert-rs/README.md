# vl-convert-rs
This crate contains the core Rust logic for interacting with the Vega-Lite JavaScript library using `deno_core`. This crate is a dependency of the `vl-convert` CLI application crate and the `vl-convert-python` Python library crate.

The `vl-convert-rs/src/module_loader/import_map.rs` file in this crate is generated by the `vl-convert-vendor` crate.

# Usage
The `VlConverter` struct may be used to perform Vega-Lite to Vega specification conversions. See `vl-convert-rs/examples/conversion1.rs` for an example, and run the example from the `vl-convert-rs` directory with:

```
$ cargo run --example conversion1
```
