        # Gym-Robotics
        Details and documentation on these robotics environments are available in OpenAI's [blog post](https://blog.openai.com/ingredients-for-robotics-research/) and the accompanying [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09464).
        
        Requirements:
        - Python 3.7 to 3.10
        - Gym v0.26
        - NumPy 1.18+
        - Mujoco 2.2.2
        
        If you use these environments, please cite the following paper:

          Title = {Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning: Challenging Robotics Environments and Request for Research},
          Year = {2018},
          Eprint = {arXiv:1802.09464},
        }
        ```
        
        ## New MuJoCo Python Bindings
        
        The latest version and future versions of the MuJoCo environments will no longer depend on `mujoco-py`. Instead the new [mujoco](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html) python bindings will be the required dependency for future gym MuJoCo environment versions. Old gym MuJoCo environment versions that depend on `mujoco-py` will still be kept but unmaintained.
        Dependencies for old MuJoCo environments can still be installed by `pip install gym_robotics[mujoco_py]`.
