# rnotes
Release notes manager.

This is kindof like reno, except it's faster because it makes some assumptions about git logs,
and uses current tag state, not branch history.


The idea is you create a folder with note files, and on your merge CI, you run a linter to ensure that your
devs are posting release notes.

The notes relevant to a tag are those committed between that tag's creation and the previous tag (if any).

Note history is then easy to extract from git tags and logs.
