Description: # Easy Inference
        
        Welcome to the easy inference repository! The main goal of this repository is to provide a clean, simple and short way of setting up inference pipelines for 2D (and 3D) visual detection.
        The interfaces to camera drivers are abstracted away as python `generators`. A simple inference pipeline for a webcam based inference pipeline looks as follows:
        
        ```Python3
        from easy_inference.providers.webcam import Webcam
        
        provider = Webcam(source=0)
        
        for frame in provider:
        
          # run my detection 
        ```
        
        See the examples directory for some `yolov7` pipelines.
