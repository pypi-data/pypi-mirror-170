    "## How to set up an optimisation that uses U-NSGA-III as the acquisition function\n",
    "\n",
    "U-NSGA-III can be used for single-objective and multi-objective problems. Like the TS-EMO method, samples are drawn from the objective functions' distributions as opposed to using the mean of the distribution directly during inference in the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The U-NSGA-III algorithm is implemented in the `NSGAImprovement` acquisition function in NEMO. The following are the steps for how this acquisition function works:\n",
    "1. The acquisition function will firstly use the U-NSGA-III algorithm to identify potential samples on the pareto front. A sampler object is not used for this step because the algorithm will actively generate it's own samples *in situ*. \n",
    "2. The new potential pareto front points will be checked against the existing pareto front in the database. The method tries to find a combination of `NSGAImprovement.num_candidates` number of data points from new potential pareto front points that improvement the existing hypervolume.\n",
    "3. If step 2 is successful, then these points will be the suggested candidates by the acquisition function.\n",
    "4. Alternatively, if step 2 fails, then the `HighestUncertainty` acquisition function is run to identify `NSGAImprovement.num_candidates` number of sets of X-values that have the highest predictive uncertainty (standard deviation) in the objective functions. The identified high uncertainty candidates are suggested as experiments to run."
