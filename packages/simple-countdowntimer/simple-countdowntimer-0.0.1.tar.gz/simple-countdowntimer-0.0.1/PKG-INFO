# Countdown Timer

This simple class allows you to simplify project that require a countdown timer. Simply set the duration of the timer either using `countdowntimer.duration` or `countdowntimer.duration_in_seconds` and then run `countdowntimer.reset()`. It will then countdown from the future time - `current_time + duration`. Once the timer is up the `isalarm` variable will become `True`. This can be put into a simple loop such as:

``` python
c = CountDownTimer()
c.duration = 1 # minute

c.reset()
while not c.isalarm():
    c.status()
    sleep(0.25)

print("Timer is done")

```

## Functional reference

Below is a description of each of the functions

---

### tick

The countdowntimer class has a `tick` function that will return the remaining time as a simple printable time string:

`countdowntimer.tick()`

---

### target_time

Returns the Target time, that is the start_time + the duration in minutes

`countdowntimer.target_time`

---

### target_str

The countdowntimer class has a `target_time_str` function that will return the future, or target time as a pretty printable string.

`countdowntimer.target_time_str()`

---

### start_time_str

The countdowntimer class has a `start_time_str` function that will return the start time - the time the counter started counting from as a pretty printable string.

`countdowntimer.start_time_str()`

---

### remaining_str

Returns the remaining time as a pretty printable string.

`countdowntimer.remaining_str()`

---

### isalarm

Returns `True` if the countdown timer target time has been reached, and `False` if the time has yet to be achieved.

`countdowntimer.isalarm()`

---

### status

If the timer hasn't reached its target time, this function prints out a single line showing:

* The Start time
* The Current Time
* The Remaining Time

`countdowntimer.status()`

## Why this class was created

This library was created for both the AI Assistant Pomodoro skill as well as the `Build your own Cute Pomodoro Desk Robot - HeyBot!` [see video below](#youtube-video).
