# pyzusi3
Library to talk to Zusi3 without any specialized purpose.

Support for ETCS and ZBS is not yet complete, however the other parts can be used freely.

Intentionally the message parameters are taken almost word-by-word from Zusi documentation to make using the lib easier.
So be prepared for some mixing of code language (english) and zusi-lib language (german).
