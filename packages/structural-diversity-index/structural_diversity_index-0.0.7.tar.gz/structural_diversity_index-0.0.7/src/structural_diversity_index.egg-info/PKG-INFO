# Structural diversity index

The package structural-diversity-index implements code for fast numerical computation of the structural diversity index.
The associated GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/ethz-coss/Structural-diversity-index).
The package's documentation ia available [here](https://rse-distance.readthedocs.io).

## Installation

To install the package and its dependencies you should create a [python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
A detailed tutorial about virtual environments is available [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). 
However, if you are in a hurry you can just open a terminal window and type

```
python3 -m venv sdi_venv
```
This creates a virtual environment called **sdi_venv** in your current directory.
Next, activate the virtual environment. This is done on Unix or macOS by typing into the terminal
```
source sdi_venv/bin/activate
```
On Windows you should type
```
sdi_venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
Once you created and activated the virtual environment you can install the structural_diversity_index package by typing into the terminal
```
pip install structural_diversity_index
```

This will install the latest version of the package in the virtual environment.

**WARNING 1**: Installing the package via pip will allow **NOT** you to use the scripts that run computations on GPUs.
See below for details of how to run the scripts computing on GPUs.

**WARNING 2**: Installing the package into an existing virtual environment can cause the code to break due to conflicts with already
existing dependencies. For this reason we advise to create a new virtual environment. 

### Installation for GPUs

If you are **not** interested in running computations on GPUs you can ignore this section.

Installing the structural_diversity_index package via pip does not enable you to run computations on GPUs.
The reason is that pip cannot install Cudatoolkit (because it is not a python package).

To circumvent this issue one can use a package installer such as [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
Once you have installed conda on your computer, download the file **environment.yml** from the [GitHub](https://github.com/ethz-coss/Structural-diversity-index).
In the terminal, go to the directory containing the environment.yml file you downloaded and type:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a conda environment called **sd_index** and install all the dependencies necessary to computations on GPUs.
Now you can set the flag on_cuda to True (see Examples.ipynb on [GitHub](https://github.com/ethz-coss/Structural-diversity-index>)) and computations will run on GPUs.

## Tutorial
The Jupyter notebook **Example.ipynb** contains a detailed tutorial explaining how to use the package structural_diversity_index.
You can find it [here](https://github.com/ethz-coss/Structural-diversity-index).


## Extending the code
If you are interested in extending or simply playing around with the code, I have created a detailed documentation with ReadTheDocs which is available [here](https://rse-distance.readthedocs.io). 
Have fun!
