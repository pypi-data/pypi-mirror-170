The rest of the process of the project's setup is outlined in the installation section below.

## Installation

### Installation from PyPI

To install from PyPI and using pip it is recommended to initially set up a virtual environment or use a package manager like poetry.

                python3 -m venv {venv-name}

Then activate the venv.

                source {venv-name}/bin/activate


Then install the package.

                pip install qub-amphibian-report-generator

## Use

Once the package has been installed and setup the Report Generator program can be used from venv with the command:

        report-generator

This will start the GUI application for the report generator

If the user wants to use the CLI:

        report-generator --cli [options]

CLI options can be found with the command:

        report-generator -h
