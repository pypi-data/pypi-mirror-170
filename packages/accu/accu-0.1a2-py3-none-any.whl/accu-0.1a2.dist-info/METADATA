# Django Accu

More batteries for Django - an opinionated package for creating a Django application faster.

## Architecture
This project is not flexible in the supported architecture, it makes clear assumptions about the used structure. It uses:
- Python >=3.9
- Django >=4.1
- DRF => 3.14
- Django Q => 1.3
- Sentry (optional)

## Provided namespaces:
### Currently available
- [ ] https://github.com/matmair/django-accu/issues/1 core.checks: checks to make sure the Django project confirms to core assumptions made
- [ ] https://github.com/matmair/django-accu/issues/2 core.config: utils to load settings from different sources (environment, .env, config files, ...)
- [ ] https://github.com/matmair/django-accu/issues/3 core.clean: clean user inputs with bleach
- [ ] https://github.com/matmair/django-accu/issues/4 core.urls: import for this project URLs
- [ ] https://github.com/matmair/django-accu/issues/5 core.utils: helper functions
- [ ] https://github.com/matmair/django-accu/issues/6 tasks: async execution of functions

### On the roadmap
- [ ] https://github.com/matmair/django-accu/issues/7 plugins: a plugin implementation for Django
- [ ] https://github.com/matmair/django-accu/issues/8 settings: database settings
- [ ] https://github.com/matmair/django-accu/issues/8 settings.api: expose the settings for consumption in apps/frontends

### TODO/to be ported from codebases
- [ ] users: expandable user (uses a profile to expand the model to keep usability with other projects high)
- [ ] changelogs
- [ ] approvals
- [ ] setups
- [ ] core.update
- [ ] reports.client (jasper-server-based)
- [ ] reports.file (jasper-file-based

### To be finished and ported:
- [ ] users.token: multi-token implementation for usage with DRF
- [ ] core.security.api: expose all core security flows via API (registration, login, logoff, deletion, MFA-actions, password-reset)
