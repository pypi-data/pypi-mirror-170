    'long_description': '# Obtaining Twitter Conversations\n\nIt is often necessary to pull not only individual tweets but entire conversations from Twitter.\n\nWith the new [Twitter API v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api), it is possible\nthat entire [conversations](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-conversations) can now\nbe queried via\nthe [conversation_id](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/conversation-id) field.\n\nThis project features the reconstruction of single or multiple conversations via already known\nentries of `conversation_id` or the search for such conversation-starting tweets on a given topic\nand related conversations within a given time period.\n\n# Setup :building_construction:\n\nFor this project [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) is\nrequired and must be installed on the hosting device.\n\nFurthermore, [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) is used as package manager.\nAny other python package manager works as well.\n\nThis project can be installed directly as a Python package using the following command:\n\n```\n    poetry add twitter-conversation\n```\n\n## Additional Stuff :nut_and_bolt:\n\n1. [Twitter API v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) (Apply for access and use\n   the [Bearer-Token](https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/))\n\n# About Conversations on Twitter :bulb:\n\nTo reconstruct or obtain conversations on Twitter, the reply-tree is used as a fundamental data\nstructure.\nA reply-tree is a rooted in-tree which is characterized by a root-tweet and reply-tweets which can\nreach this designated tweet.\n\nA root-tweet is a conversation-starting tweet if it has at least one reply-tweet and thus creates a\nconversation. A conversation is a reply-tree which does not only consists of a root-tweet.\n\nThis term reply-tree in a conversation on Twitter is also referred to as a conversation-thread.\nFurthermore, Twitter assigns the field `conversation_id` to each tweet of a conversation.\nThe `conversation_id` is the ID of this tweet, which was the first tweet of the conversation and\nthus started the conversation.\n\nTherefore, as a starting point for reconstructing and obtaining conversations, the IDs of those\ntweets that sparked a conversation are necessary.\n\n# Getting things started :rocket:\n\nThe enclosed `/scripts/`-folder can be taken for example of how to apply this library.\n\nAll available scripts are mentioned in the `[tool.poetry.scripts]` of `pyproject.toml`.\nTo see how a specific script works use:\n\n```\n   poetry run obtain --help\n```\n',
