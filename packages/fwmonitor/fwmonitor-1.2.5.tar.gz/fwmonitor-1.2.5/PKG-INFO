Description: # FWMonitor
        
        `fwmonitor` can be used to grok `IPTABLES`, `UFW` or any program that logs similar to `IPTABLES`, logs from your `syslog` (_active_) or a gathered log/text file (_passive_) in a comprehensive format in order to conduct network traffic analysis and security audit of your servers.
        
        ## Demo
        
        ![fwmonitor](https://github.com/pouriyajamshidi/fwmonitor/raw/master/images/fwmonitor.gif)
        
        ## Usage
        
        Install from `PIP`:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install fwmonitor
        ```
        
        Or clone this repository:
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/pouriyajamshidi/fwmonitor.git
        ```
        
        Make the script executable:
        
        ```bash
        chmod +x fwmonitor.py
        ```
        
        For your convenience, you can place the program in your system PATH, like `/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin/` for instance:
        
        ```bash
        sudo cp fwmonitor.py /usr/local/bin/fwmonitor
        ```

        ## Flags
        
        This script takes 4 optional arguments. These arguments are:
        
        **`--file`**: Location of log file to be scanned. Default location is **/var/log/syslog**
        
        **`--key`** : Keyword that `IPTABLES` uses to log events. Make sure of case-sensitivity and specific keyword in your log file. Default value for keyword is **"UFW BLOCK"**
        
        **`--interval`**: Interval to read the log file from scratch, this is useful for analyzing a live system. If you pass `0` here, it'll scan the log file once and exits. Default value for interval is **60 seconds**
        
        **`--ipv6`**: Display `IPv6` logs. Default is **IPv4**
        
        **`--version`**: Display version and exit
        
        _By running the script without providing any arguments, the default values as mentioned below above be used._
        
        ## Examples
        
        To analyze a log file that you have gathered:
        
        ```python
        fwmonitor --file mytraffic.log --key "IPTABLES_BLOCK" --interval 0
        # OR
        python3 fwmonitor.py --file mytraffic.log --key "IPTABLES_BLOCK" --interval 0
        ```
        
        Audit a live server:
        
        ```python
        fwmonitor --file /var/log/syslog --key "IPTABLES_BLOCK"
        # OR
        python3 fwmonitor.py --file /var/log/syslog --key "IPTABLES_BLOCK"
        ```
        
        Additionally, there is a `sample.log` in this repository that you can utilize to see how this script works without actually having a log file yourself. Use it like:
        
        ```bash
        fwmonitor --file sample.log --key "UFW BLOCK" --interval 0
        # OR
        python3 fwmonitor.py --file sample.log --key "UFW BLOCK" --interval 0
        ```
        
        ## Tested on
        
        Ubuntu.
        
        _It can be used on `Windows` and `Mac OS` as well to analyze the gathered log file(s)._
        
        ## TODO
        
        - [ ] Implement smart spacing for rows.
