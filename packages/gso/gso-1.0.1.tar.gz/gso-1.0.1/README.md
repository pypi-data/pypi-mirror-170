# GSO (Global State Observer)

GSO is an open-source Python library for managing application state.
It uses a modified version of the [Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) 
to sync UI state with application state.

GSO was originally designed to work with [PySide](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python)/[PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/),
but it works well with pretty much every class-based UI library out there.

## How to use

You will find a lot of [examples](https://github.com/youssef-attai/gso/tree/main/examples)
that can help you get started.
The examples are very simple, they are all focused on 
the pattern that works best with GSO.

You are encouraged to clone the ones that use the UI library you are working with
and have a closer look.
