# HASOC experiments

We also participated in the HASOC2021: Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification in English and Indo-Aryan Languages shared task. You can download the dataset from the official [site](https://hasocfire.github.io/hasoc/2021/index.html).

Both the notebook for preprocessing the data and our output for the task can be found under the _hasoc2021_ branch.

Precomputed graphs can be downloaded running:

```bash
bash data.sh
```

Prebuilt rule-systems are available in this directory for the _2019, 2020, 2021_ tasks. The features are mainly only built for the binary _HOF/NOT_ labels.

Then the frontend of POTATO can be started from the __frontend__ directory:

```bash
streamlit run app.py -- -t ../features/hasoc/hasoc_2021_train_amr.tsv -v ../features/hasoc/hasoc_2021_val_amr.tsv -hr ../features/hasoc/2021_train_features_task1.json
```

If you want to reproduce our output run _evaluate.py_ from the _scripts_ directory.

```bash
python evaluate.py -t amr -f ../features/hasoc/2021_train_features_task1.json -d ../features/hasoc/hasoc_2021_test_amr.tsv
```

If you want to get the classification report, run the script with the __mode__ (-m) parameter:
```bash
python evaluate.py -t amr -f ../features/hasoc/2021_train_features_task1.json -d ../features/hasoc/hasoc_2021_test_amr.tsv -m report
```

## Usage and examples on the HASOC data

__WARNING: EXPLICIT CONTENT! The examples are from the HASOC shared task of identifying offensive text.__

First import packages from potato:
```python
from xpotato.dataset.dataset import Dataset
from xpotato.models.trainer import GraphTrainer
```

First we just play with toy data manually extracted from the dataset:
```python
sentences = [("fuck absolutely everything about today.", "HOF"),
            ("I just made food and I'm making myself sick to my stomach. Lol, wtf is this shit", "HOF"),
            ("RT [USER]: America is the most fucked up country [URL]", "HOF"),
            ("you'd be blind to not see the heart eyes i have for you.", "NOT"),
            ("It's hard for me to give a fuck now", "HOF"),
            ("tell me everything", "NOT"),
            ("Bitch YES [URL]", "HOF"),
            ("Eight people a minute....", "NOT"),
            ("RT [USER]: im not fine, i need you", "NOT"),
            ("Holy shit.. 3 months and I'll be in Italy", "HOF"),
            ("Now I do what I want ðŸ¤ª", "NOT"),
            ("[USER] you'd immediately stop", "NOT"),
            ("Just... shut the fuck up", "HOF"),
            ("RT [USER]: ohhhh shit a [USER] [URL]", "HOF"),
            ("all i want is for yara to survive tonight", "NOT"),
            ("fuck them", "HOF")]
```

Initialize the dataset and also provide a label encoding. Then parse the sentences into graphs. Currently we provide three types of graphs: _ud_, _fourlang_, _amr_.

```python
dataset = Dataset(sentences, label_vocab={"NOT":0, "HOF": 1})
dataset.set_graphs(dataset.parse_graphs(graph_format="ud"))
```

### Rules

If the dataset is prepared and the graphs are parsed, we can write rules to match labels. We can write rules either manually or extract
them automatically (POTATO also provides a frontend that tries to do both).

The simplest rule would be just a node in the graph:
```python
#the syntax of the rules is List[List[rules that we want to match], List[rules that shouldn't be in the matched graphs], Label of the rule]
rule_to_match = [[["(u_1 / fuck)"], [], "HOF"]]
```

Init the rule matcher:
```python
from xpotato.graph_extractor.extract import FeatureEvaluator
evaluator = FeatureEvaluator()
```

Match the rules in the dataset:
```python
#match single feature
df = dataset.to_dataframe()
evaluator.match_features(df, rule_to_match)
```

The function will return a dataframe with the matched instances:
|    | Sentence                                                                         | Predicted label   | Matched rule                  |

| 12 | Just... shut the fuck up                                                         | HOF               | [['(u_1 / fuck)'], [], 'HOF'] |
| 13 | RT [USER]: ohhhh shit a [USER] [URL]                                             |                   |                               |
| 14 | all i want is for yara to survive tonight                                        |                   |                               |
| 15 | fuck them                                                                        | HOF               | [['(u_1 / fuck)'], [], 'HOF'] |

One of the core features of our tool is that we are also able to match subgraphs:
```python
#match a simple graph feature
evaluator.match_features(df, [[["(u_1 / fuck :obj (u_2 / everything))"], [], "HOF"]])
```

This will only return one match instead of three:
|    | Sentence                                                                         | Predicted label   | Matched rule                                          |

|  2 | RT [USER]: America is the most fucked up country [URL]                           |                   |                                                       |

We can also add negated features that we don't want to match (this won't match the first row where 'absolutely' is present):
```python
#match a simple graph feature
evaluator.match_features(df, [[["(u_1 / fuck)"], ["(u_2 / absolutely)"], "HOF"]])
```

If we don't want to specify nodes, regex can also be used in place of the node and edge-names:

```python
#regex can be used to match any node (this will match instances where 'fuck' is connected to any node with 'obj' edge)
evaluator.match_features(df, [[["(u_1 / fuck :obj (u_2 / .*))"], [], "HOF"]])
```

We can also train regex rules from a training data, this will automatically replace regex '.*' with nodes that are 
'good enough' statistically based on the provided dataframe.

```python
#regex can be used to match any node (this will match instances where 'fuck' is connected to any node with 'obj' edge)
evaluator.train_feature("HOF", "(u_1 / fuck :obj (u_2 / .*))", df)
```

This will return '(u_1 / fuck :obj (u_2 / everything|they))'] (replaced '.*' with _everything_ and _they_)

### Learning rules

To extract rules automatically, train the dataset with graph features and rank them based on relevancy:

```python
df = dataset.to_dataframe()
trainer = GraphTrainer(df)
#extract features
features = trainer.prepare_and_train()

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

train, val = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=1234)

#save train and validation, this is important for the frontend to work
train.to_pickle("train_dataset")
val.to_pickle("val_dataset")

import json

#also save the ranked features
with open("features.json", "w+") as f:
    json.dump(features, f)

```

You can also save the parsed graphs for evaluation or for caching:

```python
import pickle
with open("graphs.pickle", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(val.graph, f)
```

To see the code you can check the jupyter notebook under *notebooks/hasoc_examples.ipynb*

## Frontend

If the DataFrame is ready with the parsed graphs, the UI can be started to inspect the extracted rules and modify them. The frontend is a streamlit app, the simplest way of starting it is (the training and the validation dataset must be provided):

```
streamlit run frontend/app.py -- -t notebooks/train_dataset -v notebooks/val_dataset -g ud
```

it can be also started with the extracted features:

```
streamlit run frontend/app.py -- -t notebooks/train_dataset -v notebooks/val_dataset -g ud -sr notebooks/features.json
```

if you already used the UI and extracted the features manually and you want to load it, you can run:
```
streamlit run frontend/app.py -- -t notebooks/train_dataset -v notebooks/val_dataset -g ud -sr notebooks/features.json -hr notebooks/manual_features.json
```

### Advanced mode

If labels are not or just partially provided, the frontend can be started also in _advanced_ mode, where the user can _annotate_ a few examples at the start, then the system gradually offers rules based on the provided examples. 


Dataset without labels can be initialized with:
```python
sentences = [("fuck absolutely everything about today.", ""),
            ("I just made food and I'm making myself sick to my stomach. Lol, wtf is this shit", ""),
            ("RT [USER]: America is the most fucked up country [URL]", ""),
            ("you'd be blind to not see the heart eyes i have for you.", ""),
            ("It's hard for me to give a fuck now", ""),
            ("tell me everything", ""),
            ("Bitch YES [URL]", ""),
            ("Eight people a minute....", ""),
            ("RT [USER]: im not fine, i need you", ""),
            ("Holy shit.. 3 months and I'll be in Italy", ""),
            ("Now I do what I want ðŸ¤ª", ""),
            ("[USER] you'd immediately stop", ""),
            ("Just... shut the fuck up", ""),
            ("RT [USER]: ohhhh shit a [USER] [URL]", ""),
            ("all i want is for yara to survive tonight", ""),
            ("fuck them", "")]
```

Then, the frontend can be started:
```
streamlit run frontend/app.py -- -t notebooks/unsupervised_dataset -g ud -m advanced
```



## Evaluate
If you have the features ready and you want to evaluate them on a test set, you can run:

```python
python scripts/evaluate.py -t ud -f notebooks/features.json -d notebooks/val_dataset
```

The result will be a _csv_ file with the labels and the matched rules:
|     | Sentence                                | Predicted label | Matched rule                          |     |
| --- | --------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- | --- |
| 0   | RT [USER]: ohhhh shit a [USER] [URL]    | HOF             | ['(u_48 / shit)']                     |     |
| 1   | [USER] you'd immediately stop           | HOF             | ['(u_40 / user :punct (u_42 / LSB))'] |     |
| 2   | fuck absolutely everything about today. | HOF             |  ['(u_1 / fuck)']                            |     |
