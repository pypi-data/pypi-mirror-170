## Xby2 Azure Cloud Practice Library
#### Steps for getting started:
* Install this package
* Run xby2-init
* Activate virtual environment (.\venv\Scripts\activate)
* Install requirements (pip install -r requirements.txt)
* Add resources to resources.json file
* Run pulumi up (using active Azure profile)
* Push to BitBucket repo (Coming Soon)

#### VN:
An Azure Virtual Network is a representation of one's own network in the cloud. It is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud.
Here are the fields you can customize in KWARGS and the (defaults):  
* "address_spaces": "full",
* "resource_name": "test-vn",
* "dns_servers": ["10.0.0.4", "10.0.0.5"],
* "subnet_address_prefixes":["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"],
* "subnet_names":["test-subnet-0", "test-subnet-1"]

#### Security Group:
An Azure security group is a set of access control rules that can be wrapped around a virtual network or subnet.
Here are the fields you can customize in KWARGS and the (defaults):  
* "resource_name": "test-security-group"

#### LB:
An Azure load balancer provides high availability by distributing incoming traffic among healthy virtual machines.
Here are the fields you can customize in KWARGS and the (defaults):  
* resource_name (test-lb)

#### VM:
An Azure virtual machine is a scalable computer resource that is used to host applications.
Here are the fields you can customize in KWARGS and the (defaults):  
* "resource_name": "test-vm",
* "network_interface_name": "network_interface",
* "private_ip_address_allocation": "Dynamic",

* "subnet_id": "test-subnet-0",

* "vm_size": "Standard_DS1_v2",

* "sod_name": "test_storage_os_disk",
* "sod_caching": "ReadWrite",
* "sod_create_option": "FromImage",
* "sod_managed_disk_type": "Standard_LRS"

#### DB:
Azure SQL Database is a managed cloud database.
Here are the fields you can customize in KWARGS and the (defaults):  
* "resource_name": "test-db",
* "server_name": "erase-me"

#### Blob:
Azure Blob is a object storage solution for the cloud.
Here are the fields you can customize in KWARGS and the (defaults):    
* "resource_name": "testblob",
* "storage_account_name": "testaccount",
* "storage_container_name": "testcontainer",
* "type": "Page",
* "size": 512

#### App Service
* "resource_name": "test-app-service"

#### Nat Gateway
Azure NAT Gateway provides control over outbound network connectivity from your resources that are hosted within a virtual network.
* "resource_name": "test-nat-gateway"

#### Resource Group
Resource groups are presently the only resource where an existing instance can be retrieved from Azure as a part of our default library. This can be accomplished using an additional boolean in the resource group entry of the config file. When this variable (called "does_exist") is set to true, the program will attempt to retrieve the resource group that corresponds to the parameters provided in the overrides dictionary. The only required parameters are "resource_name" and "id" but you can feel free to include the others described in the documentation.

#### SSIS IR
* "resource_name": "test-ssis-ir",
* "data_factory_id": "test-data-factory",
* "node_size": "Standard_D1_v2",
* "location": "eastus2"

#### Account
Contains all of your Azure storage data objects.
* "resource_name": "storageaccount",
* "account_replication_type": "LRS",
* "account_tier": "Standard",
* "account_kind": "BlobStorage"

#### Container
Organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system.
* "resource_name": "testcontainer",
* "container_access_type": "blob"

#### Data Factory
Azure Data Factory is Azure's cloud ETL service for scale-out serverless data integration and data transformation.
* "resource_name": "test-data-factory"

#### Dataset
Contains the input to be processed.
* "resource_name": "dataset-[VARIES]"

#### Linked Service
Defines the connection information needed for the service to connect to external resources.
* "resource_name": "ls-[VARIES]"

#### Adding Resources:
Keep the order of declaration in mind. For example, the resource group, followed by the VN should likely be the first things declared. When using the options above, the resource will use require a "module", which will refer to a file within the BaseAzure folder, a "resource_name", which will be the name of one of our custom classes, and "overrides", which will be a list of any parameters that we want changed from the default values. Additionally, we can create resources that we haven't customized. This will require a "module", which will probably begin with "pulumi_azure.", the "resource_name", which will be a class within said module, "overrides", which will consist of **all** of the parameters needed for this resource, and the aforementioned booleans. Below is an example of an item in the resources list:  
```json
{
    "module": "BaseAzure.vm",
    "resource_name": "BaseVM",
    "overrides": {}
}
```
