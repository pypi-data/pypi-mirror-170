        Configure an on-grid replica.

        Once a replica has been configured this node will keep that replica
        up-to-date with local state changes.

            The replication system is now configured.

            A replica has not necessarily been created yet but ZKAPAuthorizer
            will begin creating one now.  The response includes the recovery
            capability for that replica.
