"""
Calculate the price, in ZKAPs, for storing files.

The underlying storage system operates only on individual shares.  Thus, it
*does not* use this file-oriented calculator.  However, for end-users,
file-oriented pricing is often more helpful.  This calculator builds on the
share-oriented price calculation to present file-oriented price information.

It accounts for erasure encoding data expansion.  It does not account for the
real state of the storage system (e.g., if some data is *already* stored then
storing it "again" is essentially free but this will not be reflected by this
calculator).
