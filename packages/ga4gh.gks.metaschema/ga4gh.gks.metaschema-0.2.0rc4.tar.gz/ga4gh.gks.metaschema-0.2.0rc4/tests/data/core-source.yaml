  Entity:
    description: >-
      Entity is the root class of ‘core’ classes model - those that have identifiers and other general 
      metadata like labels, xrefs, urls, descriptions, etc. All core classes descend from and inherit 
      its attributes.
    heritable_properties:
      id:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, e.g. a UUID. This 'id' is 
          unique within a given system. The identified entity may have a different 'id' in a different 
          system, or may refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in another system (e.g. a CURIE).
      type:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The schema class that is instantiated by the data object. Must be the name of a class from 
          the VA schema.

  ValueEntity:
    inherits: Entity
    description: >-

        description: >-
          The 'logical' identifier of the entity in the system of record, and MUST be represented as a CURIE.
          This 'id' is unique within a given system, but may also refer to an 'id' for the shared concept in 
          another system (represented by namespace, accordingly).

  DomainEntity:
    inherits: ValueEntity
    description: >-
      An abstract :ref:`ValueEntity` class extended to capture specific domain entities by reference

  ExtensibleEntity:

  RecordMetadata:
    inherits: ExtensibleEntity
    description: >-
      A re-usable structure that encapsulates provenance metadata that applies to a specific

  Coding:
    inherits: ExtensibleEntity
    description: >-
      A `coding` is an extensible entity for labeling or otherwise annotating globally 
      namespaced identifiers known as "codes".

  Extension:
    description: >-
      The Extension class provides VODs with a means to extend descriptions
      with other attributes unique to a content provider. These extensions
      are not expected to be natively understood under VRSATILE, but may be
      used for pre-negotiated exchange of message attributes when needed.
