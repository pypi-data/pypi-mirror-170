  HumanCytoband:
    description: >-
      A character string representing cytobands derived from the
      *International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature* (ISCN)
      `guidelines <http://doi.org/10.1159/isbn.978-3-318-06861-0>`_.
    type: string
    pattern: '^cen|[pq](ter|([1-9][0-9]*(\.[1-9][0-9]*)?))$'
    example: "q22.3"

  Residue:
    description: >-
      A character representing a specific residue (i.e., molecular species)
      or groupings of these ("ambiguity codes"), using `one-letter IUPAC
      abbreviations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry#Amino_acid_and_nucleotide_base_codes>`_
      for nucleic acids and amino acids.
    type: string
    pattern: '[A-Z*\-]'

  Sequence:
    description: >-
      A character string of :ref:`Residues <Residue>` that represents a biological
      sequence using the conventional sequence order (5’-to-3’ for
      nucleic acid sequences, and amino-to-carboxyl for amino acid
      sequences). IUPAC ambiguity codes are permitted in Sequences.
    type: string
    pattern: '^[A-Z*\-]*$'
