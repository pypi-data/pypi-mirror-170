Enqueue what you want to capture with `enqueue` (it returns a UUID)\n2. Trigger the capture itself. For that, you have two options\n\n  * The `capture` method directly, if you pass it the UUID you got from `enqueue`.\n    This is what you want to use to do the capture in the same process as the one enqueuing the capture\n\n  * If you rather want to enqueue the captures in one part of your code and trigger the captures in an other one,\n    use `consume_queue` which will pick a capture from the queue and trigger the capture.\n    I this case, you should use `get_capture_status` to check if the capture is over before the last step.\n\n3. Get the capture result with `get_capture` with the UUID from you got from `enqueue`.\n',
