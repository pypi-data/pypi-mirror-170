Preface
--------

For most scholars of geosciences or meteorology, data processing is a big project, which can take several hours or days of data processing. Without good tools or methods, it will be extremely difficult to analyze and research data with multiple time series (such as time series remote sensing data) and large-scale (such as nationwide), because data processing itself is very time-consuming and labor-intensive.

In order to solve these problems, gma (Geographic and Meteorological Analysis) encapsulates the data processing process (Depends on gdal, pandas, numpy et al.). 

Climate and meteorology (climet)

Thanks
--------

Thank you for giving me encouragement, classmates, colleagues and friends all the way. Because of your existence, I have more power to complete. I will not list the personnel here, but I still sincerely thank you.

Due to the limited level, there will be more or less problems in the function. Looking forward to your feedback and corrections. 

More functions will be added later. I hope you can provide valuable comments.
