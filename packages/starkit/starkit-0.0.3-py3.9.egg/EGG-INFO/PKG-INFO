alpha_calculation(xt, yt, zt, x, y, z, w, sizes, limAlpha)

where:

sizes = [ a5, b5, c5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, b10, c10 ]

a5 - distance between axis of symmetry and axis of servo drive number 5 (mm)
b5 - distance between axis of servo drives в„–5 and #6 in horizontal plane (mm)
c5 - distance between axis of servo drive в„–6 and origin point of Z axis (mm)
a6 - distance between axis of servo drives в„–6 and в„–7 (mm)
a7 - distance between axis of servo drives в„–7 and в„–8 (mm)
a8 - distance between axis of servo drives в„–8 and в„–9 (mm)
a9 - distance between axis of servo drives в„–9 and в„–10 (mm)
a10 - distance between axis of servo drive в„–10 and foot in horizontall plane (mm)
b10 - distance between axis of servo drive в„–10 and foot (mm)
c10 - distance between axis of servo drives в„–6 and в„–10 in horizontal plane (mm)

xt, yt, zt, x, y, z, w may be double or long types
sizes - list of sizes in robot's body
